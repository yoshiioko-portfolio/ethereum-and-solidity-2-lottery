# Ethereum and Solidity: Lottery Project

This is the second project from Stephen Grider's "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide" Udemy course. It creates a contract that allows users to bid into a pool of ether and allows the contract creator to select a winner via a random process. It also includes a simple frontend application implemented using React.

My contract was deployed to the Rinkeby Testnet at this address: 0x957f9c0827AaA0f0D1c9561b9b76c38a425a58Cf

The URL for the frontend is here: https://ethereum-and-solidity-2-lottery-react-63hv0chtb-yoshiioko.vercel.app/
